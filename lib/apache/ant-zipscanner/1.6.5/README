Fork of ant 1.6.5, including only the types required to scan a zip file, with
many extra methods commented out.

Created by building the https://github.com/vertispan/ant-zipscanner repo and
copying the output jar, source jar into here. Upgrading to a new ant version
will require making a new branch in that repository, copying over the requisite
files from ant, and pruning Project/Reference/etc references that are not
needed just to scan a zip file, and then removing unused methods to further
limit the API surface area.
